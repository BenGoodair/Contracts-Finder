# Contracts-Finder
This is a library to scrape and reconcile all awarded contracts deposited on [contracts finder](https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/).

For the moment, it is a work in progress, with a concept scraper built which works but needs small tuning to improve the parsing of the text. Eventually I hope to present the data on a dashboard which automatically updates daily and publish academic papers detailing the findings.

This work is inspired by the brilliancy of Charles Rahal
